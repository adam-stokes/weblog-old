<h2>In closing</h2>
<p>Finally, throughout my journey in the opensource community, handling the balance of both community and paying customers I have been lucky enough to experience both ends of the spectrum and everything in between. From my experience I've accomplished roles from frontline support calls, customer on-site visits, sustaining engineering, and engineering.</p>
<p>I am intimately familiar with processes from both Red Hat and Canonical. I've been fortunate enough to have had my contributions utilized in the progression of an idea to product launch. My understanding of procedures for customer satisfaction, setting expectations, and providing insightful education to my peers are exceptional and increasing every day.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer in getting what you paid for and the value of customer relationship. Every day I strive to exceed excellence and always on the lookout for productive ways to solve problems quicker in order to provide the highest customer satisfaction.</p>
