### Projects and prior accomplishments

List of current software can be found at [my software page](/pages/Software)

[Matahari](https://github.com/matahari/matahari)

Before Canonical, I worked for 7 years at [Red Hat, Inc](http://redhat.com). where I started from the bottom of the totem pole and finally ended my stay with them in their Engineering &amp; RD for Virtualization technologies. My last project with them was **Matahari**, which was basically systems management and monitoring for the cloud.

See more on my [Github](https://github.com/battlemidget) page.

### Contributions

[sosreport](https://github.com/sosreport/sosreport)

I am also one of the core maintainers with **sosreport**. Which is basically a system's data collector for helping engineers get a peek at a clients system in order to help further troubleshoot or reproduce an issue.

Since working with Canonical I've done a lot of Debian/Ubuntu specific work for sosreport in order to have proper packaging and make sosreport's gathering routines applicable on those distributions.

You can find sosreport in Debian and Ubuntu archives. As of Ubuntu Saucy, sosreport will be included in the main archives.

[django-sslserver](https://github.com/teddziuba/django-sslserver/commits?author=battlemidget)

Run development django servers with ssl support.

[Vagrantpress](https://github.com/ajscg/vagrantpress)

Project for automating vagrant deployments with php, wordpress, and mysql configured automatically.

[vagrant-lxc](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc)

Project for setting up Vagrant boxes with an lxc provider. I've added support for [Salt Stack](http://saltstack.org) as a provisioner option.

[Firefox Collection - shakeNbake](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/battlemidget/shakenbake/)

Firefox addons I've found useful.

## In closing

Finally, throughout my journey in the opensource community, handling the balance of both community and paying customers I have been lucky enough to experience both ends of the spectrum and everything in between. From my experience I've accomplished roles from frontline support calls, customer on-site visits, sustaining engineering, and engineering.

I am intimately familiar with processes from both Red Hat and Canonical. I've been fortunate enough to have had my contributions utilized in the progression of an idea to product launch. My understanding of procedures for customer satisfaction, setting expectations, and providing insightful education to my peers are exceptional and increasing every day.

I am a firm believer in getting what you paid for and the value of customer relationship. Every day I strive to exceed excellence and always on the lookout for productive ways to solve problems quicker in order to provide the highest customer satisfaction.
