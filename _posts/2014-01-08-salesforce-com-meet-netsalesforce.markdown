<p>I've got a couple of new perl packages written for interacting with Salesforce.com, it's features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>OAuth 2 authentication with support for scopes including refresh_token and api. Easily add more for what you need in your application.</li>
<li>Client that will query sobjects via JSON api so no more SOAP!</li>
</ul>
<p>Net::Salesforce is in pretty good condition to be used daily and Net::Salesforce::Client is usable but needs more models added to interact with Salesforce API. So far I've got models written for Accounts and Cases with more coming soon.</p>
<p>As always contributions welcomed! You can find the code hosted on github at the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/battlemidget/Net-Salesforce">Net::Salesforce</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/battlemidget/Net-Salesforce-Client">Net::Salesforce::Client</a></li>
</ul>
