Issues resolved in this release:

[Closed items][1]

Enhancements:

  * Full Python 3.x support
  * Further modularized openstack plugins
  * Switched the build to use pybuild
  * Reports are generated by default
  * Further sanitizing of all openstack credentials
  * As of Ubuntu Trusty (14.04) sosreport will be included in the server iso&#8217;s.

Our next point release 3.1.1 could use contributors help to resolve a few low hanging fruit issues and is a great way to get familiar with Python.
