<p>I've spent some time working on a <a href="https://github.com/battlemidget/vimntu">stupid simple script</a> that would install latest snapshot of VIM along with <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">janus</a> and my additional plugins. It's really easy to get started, to install simply run:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -L https://github.com/battlemidget/vimntu/raw/master/vimntu | bash
</code></pre>
<p>You get all the modifications from <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">janus</a> in addition to an extensive set of plugins activated through pathogen that gives extensive support to most of the major programming languages.</p>
