While messing around with juju 1.18.x I managed to stumble across a setup that allows me to deploy both LXC and KVM containers in a single environment.

## Pre-reqs

  * Juju v1.18 or higher
  * libvirt-bin
  * lxc
  * Ubuntu Trusty or higher (only one I tested this on)

## The juju environments.yaml

Very simple configuration for this

    default: local
    
    environments:
      local:
        type: local
        lxc-use-clone: true
        container: kvm
    

**Note** *lxc-use-clone* was introduced in juju 1.18.3 and 1.19.2. This will greatly reduce the wait time it takes to deploy systems into containers no matter the provider used (as long as it supports lxc)

## Networking modification

In order for the machines to talk to one another we need to make sure that the KVM machine that&#8217;s housing the lxc containers are utilizing the same network that the KVM uses. So if we didn&#8217;t modify the network and attempted to deploy you would have **machine 1** with an ip of like **10&#46;0.3.1** and when you deploy a service to an lxc container within that KVM it would assign an address of **10&#46;0.4.x** or whatever the lxcbr0 is using for its network.

To fix this you&#8217;ll want to make sure that the KVM machine is using a host only network where lxcbr0 is bridged to the **eth0** device. The output below shows a simple way to make this work:

In your **/etc/network/interfaces.d/lxcbr0.cfg** file put the following:

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet manual
    
    auto lxcbr0
    iface lxcbr0 inet dhcp
        bridge_ports eth0
    

From there you can remove the existing **eth0.cfg** file and reboot your kvm instance. Once rebooted you can `juju deploy mysql --to lxc:1` and it&#8217;ll have the correct ip associated with it so that all kvm/lxc containers can communicate with one another.

## Bootstrap and Deploy

    $ juju bootstrap
    $ juju set-constraints mem=2G
    $ juju add-machine
    $ juju deploy openstack-dashboard --to lxc:1
    $ juju deploy mysql --to lxc:1
    $ juju deploy keystone --to lxc:1
    $ juju add-machine
    $ juju deploy nova-compute
    

What this does is deploy a few openstack components to kvm and LXC where the KVM instances are your separate machines and lxc being containers within the KVM machine.

  * At this time it is not currently recommended to do it this way.
  * I say do it anyway and see what you can deploy.
