Sometimes our default constraints for a Single Installation isn't enough. With our latest release it is possible to now configure the service placements with custom constraints.

Below is a fully working config example that you can modify to suit your hardware:

```yaml
install_type: Single
placements:
  controller:
    assignments:
      LXC:
      - nova-cloud-controller
      - glance
      - glance-simplestreams-sync
      - openstack-dashboard
      - juju-gui
      - keystone
      - mysql
      - neutron-api
      - neutron-openvswitch
      - rabbitmq-server
      - swift-proxy
    constraints:
      cpu-cores: 2
      mem: 6144
      root-disk: 20480
  nova-compute-machine-0:
    assignments:
      BareMetal:
      - nova-compute
    constraints:
      mem: 4096
      root-disk: 40960
  quantum-gateway-machine-0:
    assignments:
      BareMetal:
      - quantum-gateway
    constraints:
      mem: 2048
      root-disk: 20480
  swift-storage-machine-0:
    assignments:
      BareMetal:
      - swift-storage
    constraints: &id001 {}
  swift-storage-machine-1:
    assignments:
      BareMetal:
      - swift-storage
    constraints: *id001
  swift-storage-machine-2:
    assignments:
      BareMetal:
      - swift-storage
    constraints: *id001
```

Looking under the constraints for the **controller** you can expand on the disk storage, memory, and cpus that will be allocated to that service during deployment.

To make use of this config run:

```bash
$ sudo openstack-install -c config.yaml
```

It'll walk you through setting a password and selecting the Single install mode. Once the installer is to the point of deployment it'll automatically pickup your placements configuration and deploy based on those updated constraints.
