<p>We&#39;ve got an aggressive feature list for the next milestone release and welcome any involvement from the community. A few of the big ticket items are the following:</p>
<h2 id=&#34;toppriorityitems&#34;>Top priority items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.3 <em>and</em> Python 2.7 support - yes we&#39;d like to keep supporting older python versions if possible :)</li>
<li>Sos object model archive (SOMA) - This feature is for allowing other applications interface with the data collected by sosreport.</li>
<li>DBUS integration - We&#39;d like to have this feature so that controlling the behavior of sosreport is easily integrated into other systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional <a href=&#34;https://github.com/sosreport/sosreport/issues?labels=high&#38;amp;milestone=2&#38;amp;page=1&#38;amp;state=open&#34;>high priority issues</a> are also available.</p>
<h3 id=&#34;otherimportantitemstonote:&#34;>Other important items to note:</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Plugins</em> - As technologies evolve and new software rises we are always welcoming new plugins to capture the necessary data to aid in debugging those technologies. If you&#39;ve got something in mind its just a simple <a href=&#34;https://github.com/sosreport/sosreport&#34;>pull request</a> away to get it on the right track for inclusion.</li>
<li>Tests - Our goal is to be at 100% (I think we&#39;re at about 69%) coverage with a wide range of unittests. So if you fancy quality assurance then this is an excellent opportunity for you :D</li>
</ul>
